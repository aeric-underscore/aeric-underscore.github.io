      description:
        - Led a team of 5 undergraduates to create 3D visualizations on supercomputers of neutron stars, black hole disks, and binary black holes using an internally developed, VisIt CLI-based code.
        - Developed a set of Python/Bash/C++ scripts that extract and visualize gravitational waveforms from numerical relativity simulation data.
        - Co-developed a set of Python scripts that can measure the proper circumference of black holes, neutron stars, and accretion disks in curved spacetime.
        - Award-winning visualizations featured in 3 Phys. Rev. D articles and CASC 2023.
