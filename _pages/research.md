### Numerical Relativity


During my undergrad at UIUC, I worked in the Illinois Relativity Group. We solved Einstein's equations on supercomputers to study the physics of compact object systems like neutron stars, accretion disks around black holes, and binary systems. Below are some of the threads I was involved with.

- [Scientific visualization (under construction)]()
