I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant in the Illinois Relativity Group. We solve Einstein's equations on supercomputers to study the physics of compact object systems like neutron stars, accretion disks around black holes, and binary systems. Below are some of the threads I am or was involved with.

- [Scientific visualization](../NR_scivis)
